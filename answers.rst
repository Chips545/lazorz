Peerbind
--------
    - TurboGears Quickstart
    - One controller method to accept an event (peerbind API) stored in beaker
      cache
    - Method in controller that returns events stored in the beaker cache
    - This works if both players start at same time, and don't place any tiles
      before other connects
    - Totally MMO, no matching

Stateful Games
--------------
    - Build a SQLAlchemy model that mirrors game state
